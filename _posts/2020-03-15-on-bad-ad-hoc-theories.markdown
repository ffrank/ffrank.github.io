summary: A response to an irresponsible COVID-19 post
---

I have a soft spot for ad hoc theories, even bad ones, as long as they are
[funny](https://bahfest.com/). These early days of 2020, though, the fun has
escaped us by and large, and creative minds can go to some dark places.
I ended up getting into a brief Twitter discussion with [Mattias
Geniar](https://twitter.com/mattiasgeniar) concerning a [blog
post](https://ma.ttias.be/government-act-corona-covid-19/) in which he puts
forth the proposition that countries deliberately delay a their attempts to
[Flatten The Curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/) of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic in order to "save money on medical expenses".

## This is preposterous

Mattias is making quite some assumptions here, and presenting them has hard
facts.

First, I think there is a very fundamental misunderstanding of the metaphor
that FlattenTheCurve is using to give weight to their message. The arbitrary
"capacity of the health care system" line drawn into their hallmark diagram?
That is not a hard number that anybody knows. Show me a medical professional
who will, with a straight face, say that "we can handle 1.3 million infected
at any point in time, but 1.4 million will overtax us". I will show you a
person who is making shit up as they go.

Sure, you can try and make estimates. In fact, some were made for the US
health care system that suggest that it's unfeasible to [flatten the curve
adequately](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727).
But here's the other side of that coin: Even if you *could* produce reliable
numbers (you cannot because spread and lethality of an infection usually
varies between geographies, and we have little data to go on outside of
China's), how do you make sure that you choose the exact right time of engaging
measures to max out at that exact number?

Your measures kick in at a time when the rate of infection is X, the number of
infected is Y, with an effect of limiting the rate to Z. All of these can only
be estimated quite roughly. You don't know how many are infected. The number of
confirmed cases is a very bare minimum. You don't know how fast it spreads in
your geography. And you sure as hell don't know how well your measures will pan
out.

The idea of Flatten The Curve is to make your best effort, and *hope* that the
peak of the spread will stay at a manageable level. For most countries, it will
not. But even by just lowering it by, say, a million people at the peak,
thousands of lives could be saved.

## Trading lives for cash?

Another assumption in the post is problematic in two ways. First, there is the
proposition that a high but short peak with a significant death toll will incur
lower medical costs than a prolonged period of fighting a creeping epidemic.
And while this is not totally unreasonable, it does lack any backing facts.
How can you be so sure the costs from a sudden outbreak, including chaos and
death, will be lower than fighting a disease over time? Show your work.
You don't just get to just re-label axis on a diagram to prove an arbitrary
point you're trying to make. That's not how any of this works. (This is some
Trump level of misinformation.)

But even when assumption holds true, it's deeply cynical and a
bad, bad accusation against world leaders, to conclude that this trade is
being made willingly. "Well yes, we could take action now, but we will save
a half trillion by waiting until Tuesday" is *not* a statement a normal person
will make if thousands or more lives are at stake. This is some conspiracy
theory level of bullshit and I will not stand for it.

## So why were they slow?

I won't get too far into my own assumptions on the matter. I'm pretty much in
the camp of [JÃ¼rgen Klopp](https://twitter.com/EuropeanUnionC/status/1236236262325080064)
on this one. Still, I will make just one minor counter-point from my actual
(if second hand) experience.

Yes, politicians have to think carefully of how and when they act. Lives are
always at stake, not only from impending public health risks. And bear in mind,
politicians are just people like you and me, at the end of the day. They get
inconsistent information as well, and not only from social media, but also from
actual experts on all kinds of matters.

How *do* you Flatten The Curve as much as humanly possible? You lock the
country down. You force everyone to stay at home. You pause daily business.
You do whatever necessary to keep your grounded people from starving. Easy,
right?

No, of course not. It's very hard, very costly, and it has serious consequences
for the nation, that may be felt for years to come, depending on how your
economy is structured. Germany has been fairly late in taking actual action
when faced with climbing numbers of confirmed infections. And when it happened
last Friday, in order to take effect next week, the measures turned out to be
quite low-key, a far cry what China, but also neighboring European countries
resolved to do.

And yet, even with these slight modifications, people will be affected. My
gym teacher tells me, if this "soft lock-down" persists for more than a month,
he will likely starve and/or lose his home (along with his family) just from
missed income. Millions of people will be hit hard by this type of consequence.
You don't just "do whatever it takes" to curb a disease and then life goes on.
Some lives *cannot* go on depending on your choices. You don't make these
choices lightly, and hence you cannot really rush them.

Yes, our governments did not act as soon as they might have. They were kept
by all kinds of factors that you or I are not even aware of. Yes, money plays
a role. So does the public reaction (see: Panic Shopping). And yes, some
politicians may even have been clinging to hope that maybe the infection would
be contained in whatever areas it originally popped up. It's called "human
error".

And I argue we all should hold on to our hope. But also act responsibly and each
do our respective part to protect one another. Help out your neighbor whose
livelihood is in danger. But for the love of god, don't spread your half-assed
opinions on what guides public decision making in these trying times.
It's actually harmful.
