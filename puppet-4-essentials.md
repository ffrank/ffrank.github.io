A short introduction to my second book project, Puppet 4 Essentials - Second Edition, available from Packt Publishing.

**Update:** Read this amazing [review](/puppet-essentials/review.html) that the illustrious
[John Arundel](http://bitfieldconsulting.com/about) kindly wrote for me.

## The next generation

![Puppet 4 Essentials Cover](https://d1ldz4te4covpm.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/1107OS_4980_Puppet%20Essentials%20Second%20Edition.jpg)

This book is very similar to [Puppet Essentials](/puppet-essentials/index.html) (its first edition)
but worth your while for the following reasons:

 * added way more diagrams for easier comprehension
 * improved lots of little details
 * no seriously, there's like 500% more diagrams :-)
 * updated instructions to work with Puppet 4 and most importantly
 * dropped the final chapter in favor of a new one that deals with Puppet 4 exlusively

For Puppet 4 coverage and general awesomeness, I cooperated with [Example42](http://www.example42.com/)'s
[Martin Alfke](http://www.martin-alfke.de/) himself, making this his book debut!

No collection of Puppet Essentials titles is complete without this work ;o)
